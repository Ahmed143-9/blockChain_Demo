## Design Principles Applied
1. **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear information organization
2. **Consistent Motion** - Cohesive animation language
3. **Accessibility** - Sufficient contrast and readable text
4. **Professional Tone** - Sophisticated but not overwhelming
5. **Brand Alignment** - Colors and style match ArbiGrow identity

## Technical Implementation
All animations use pure CSS with:
- `@keyframes` for custom animations
- `transform` properties for smooth performance
- `backdrop-filter` for glass effects
- `rgba()` colors for transparency control
- Responsive units (`rem`, `%`, `vw`) for scalability

The design maintains the professional, trustworthy feel while adding visual interest to engage visitors during the pre-launch period.
