# Image Visibility Enhancement

## Overview
The background image has been enhanced to be more clearly visible while maintaining readability of text elements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Background Gradient Adjustment
- **Before**: `rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.85)` and `rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.85)` (high opacity)
- **After**: `rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.3)` and `rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.3)` (low opacity)
- **Result**: More of the background image is visible through the gradient

### 2. Text Contrast Enhancement
Added text shadows to ensure readability:
- **Main Title**: `text-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`
- **Subtitle**: `text-shadow: 1px 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`
- **Description**: `text-shadow: 1px 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`
- **Countdown Title**: `text-shadow: 1px 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`
- **Feature Title**: `text-shadow: 1px 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`
- **Info Text**: `text-shadow: 1px 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`

### 3. Element Visibility Enhancement
- **Timer Display**: Increased background opacity to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` and added stronger text shadow
- **Feature Cards**: Increased background opacity to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)` and added box shadows
- **Info Section**: Increased background opacity to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)` and added box shadows
- **Description Section**: Increased background opacity to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` and added strong box shadows
- **Countdown Section**: Increased background opacity to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` and added strong box shadows

### 4. Border Enhancement
- Increased border opacity from `0.2` to `0.3` for better definition of elements

## Result
